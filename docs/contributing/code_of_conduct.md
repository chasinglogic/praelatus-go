# Praelatus Code of Conduct

## Conduct

Contact: [mods@praelatus.io](mailto:mods@praelatus.io)

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
  sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race,
  ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

- On IRC, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might
  detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

- Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude. Respect
  that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
  implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
  a right answer.

- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
  want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
  That is not welcome behaviour.

- Harrassment of any kind. If you have any lack of clarity about what might be
  included in that concept please read our definition below. In particular we
  want everyone to have fun and feel included. If someone is doing the opposite
  of that either publically or privately while working as a representative of
  the project and you see it or are the target of harrasment, please contact
  the mods via email [mods@praelatus.io](mailto:mods@praelatus.io) so
  appropriate action can be taken.

- Trolling, political posting, or otherwise inflammatory behavior. Praelatus is
  a technical project and therefore is a place for technical arguments,
  not a place to have political, or some otherwise opinion-based, debate.

We interpret the term “harassment” as the following:
  - Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another
    person.
  - Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise
    discriminatory language.
  - Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material. 
  - Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying
    information, colloquially called "doxing".
  - Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation,
    race, religion, or disability.
  - Inappropriate photography or recording. Inappropriate physical contact. You
    should have someone’s consent before touching them.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes;
    inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
  - Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. Sustained
    disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.


## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of conduct. If
you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the [Praelatus
moderation team](mailto:mods@praelatus.io).

- Remarks that violate the Praelatus standards of conduct, including hateful,
  hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. Cursing is
  allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.
  (The advice I give is stop and think "would Linux Torvalds word this response
  this way?". If the answer is yes then you probably shouldn't post it or
  reword it.)
- Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of
  conduct or not, are also not allowed.
- Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
- If the warning is unheeded, the user will be “kicked,” i.e., kicked
  out of the communication channel to cool off.
- If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned,
  i.e., indefinitely excluded.
- Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first
  offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
- If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it
  up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, in private.
  Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.
- Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a
  moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway
  than others.

In the Praelatus community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each
other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best
self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues,
particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary
fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from
the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to
be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize.
Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good
there was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your
responsibility to make your fellow Praelatusaceans comfortable. Everyone wants to
get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about
cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent
and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

The enforcement policies listed above apply to all official Praelatus venues;
including official IRC channels (#praelatus, #praelatus-dev), GitHub
repositories under the Praelatus organization, and all other official forums of
communication. For other projects adopting the Praelatus Code of Conduct,
please contact the maintainers of those projects for enforcement. If you wish
to use this code of conduct for your own project, consider explicitly
mentioning your moderation policy or making a copy with your own moderation
policy so as to avoid confusion.
