# Praelatus

An Open Source bug tracker and ticketing system. It is licensed under the
[Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/chasinglogic/praelatus/blob/master/LICENSE)

# Why Praelatus?

Praelatus is a modern bug tracker and ticketing system inspired by JIRA,
BugZilla, and the many support ticketing systems members of the Core Team
have used throughout their careers.

Grown from frustration with today’s disparate and difficult methods of bug
reporting, Praelatus aims to simplify the way other
[Open Source](https://opensource.org/) projects operate. Through intuitive
workflows and support for “Internet Driver’s License” accounts such as Github,
Google, and Twitter, any user can submit a ticket in three clicks or less –
including account creation – without the need of a user manual (though we wrote
one anyway because you can't have too much documentation).

# Contributing

Praelatus is built with [Python](https://python.org) and
[Django](https://djangoproject.org). We're open to any and all contributions.
Please read our [Contribution Documentation](contributing/) docs first.
