# Welcome to the Praelatus Documentation!

## What is Praelatus?

Praelatus is an open source bug tracker and ticketing system inspired
by JIRA, BugZilla, and the many support ticketing systems members of
the Core Team have used throughout their careers. Praelatus is
released under Apache Version 2.0 License

## Why Praelatus?

Grown from frustration with today's disparate and difficult methods of
bug reporting, Praelatus aims to simplify the way other Open Source
projects operate. Through intuitive workflows and support for
"Internet Driver's License" accounts such as Github, Google, and
Twitter, any user can submit a ticket in three clicks or less -
including account creation - without the need of a user manual.


## Supported Platforms

Praelatus supports running on Mac, Windows, and Linux. You'll need a
few dependencies setup to get it running however. If you're curious
about deploying Praelatus we have docs for that

## Tech Stack

Praelatus is written using Python and React.js leveraging the large
support systems for these two languages to provide a great balance
between developer productivity and performance.
