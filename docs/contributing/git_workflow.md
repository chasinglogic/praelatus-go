# Praelatus Git Workflow

Praelatus uses a "master is develop" branching model as this forces us to keep
our tests up to date and comprehensive.

# Branches

Praelatus has only one "long lived" branch `master` (or from the perspective of
someone with a local copy `origin/master`). The tip of this branch is the
current "Nightly" or development version of Praelatus. We use [git
tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) to mark releases on
the master branch. This keeps our branches from becoming cluttered with a bunch
of junk and inevitably growing over time.

When working on a new feature you would branch from `master` giving the branch
a name that indicates what you're working on. For instance if we were adding
the project administration pages we would run the following command:

```bash
           # New branch name      Branch we're starting from
git branch project-administration master
```

The same general rules apply when creating a branch for a bugfix just give it a
name indicative of what you're doing:

```bash
git branch queries-respect-permissions master
```

We call these "topic" branches. We don't follow a specific naming convention,
if the name is short and to the point then it's probably good enough.

# Merging and Rebasing

We use Pull Requests and merges to bring these changes back into `master`
however, we try to keep the branches to as few commits as possible. Generally 1
to 2 commits for a branch. We do this through `git rebase` and
[squashing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History). This
allows us to keep the project mangeable from a history perspective as well as
encourages high quality commit messages. For those unfamiliar with git however
this can be a daunting task the first time so below we have written a
tutorial on how to perform these steps. If you're already familiar with
rebasing and squashing then move on to [Commit Messages](#commit-messages)


Let's say that you've done some updates to the deployment documentation,
written some new documentation, and while you were at it you noticed the
`tox.ini` had old configuration information so you updated it. Your branch is
called more-docs and your `git log` looks something like this:

```
commit 54bac418947a0f6882aac528dbca9747a8e76b52 (HEAD -> more-docs)
Author: Mathew Robinson <chasinglogic@gmail.com>

    WIP: Fix tox config so it matches new settings

commit 745353784c549299465ce1910738ea848248c18c
Author: Mathew Robinson <chasinglogic@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Jul 27 13:54:23 2017 -0400

    WIP: update deployment docs

commit 61626d856b8d6caa4d4251beff34149c36fdc567 (origin/more-docs)
Author: Mathew Robinson <chasinglogic@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 26 16:18:17 2017 -0400

    write apache and nginx docs
```

You originally set out to just write some more documentation but made a few
minor fixes along the way. This is totally fine but what we're going to do is
"squash" all of these commits into one big commit with a descriptive commit
message. To do this we need to run:

```
git rebase -i master
```

You'll then be prompted with the following in your git editor:

```
pick 61626d8 write apache and nginx docs
pick 7453537 WIP: update deployment docs
pick 54bac41 WIP: Fix tox config so it matches new settings

# Rebase 5c5add7..54bac41 onto 5c5add7 (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

If you read the documentation below you'll see that we can use squash to meld
everything into the commit before it. So update this text file accordingly:

```
pick 61626d8 write apache and nginx docs
squash 7453537 WIP: update deployment docs
squash 54bac41 WIP: Fix tox config so it matches new settings

# Rebase 5c5add7..54bac41 onto 5c5add7 (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

Then save and exit the file, if all goes well git will prompt you to write a
new commit message and so you can view [Commit Messages](#commit-messages)
below to see how we want the commit messages formatted.

## Dealing with broken rebases

Sometimes all of your commits won't play nice when squashed. In this instance
you'll get something that is kind of like a merge conflict except you have to
"play through" each commit. The workflow for getting through this is:

```bash
# Run git status to find "unmergable" files
git status

# Find broken chunks of files by looking for the <<<<<<< HEAD and making the
# appropriate edits then:
git rebase --continue
# Update the commit message if necessary
```

View the [rebasing
docs](https://help.github.com/articles/using-git-rebase-on-the-command-line/)
for more information.

# Commit Messages

We follow a slightly more structured version of the [Tim
Pope](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
commit message guidelines. Our template commit looks like this:

```
Summary of Bug or Title of Feature

Short description of problem followed by a detailed description of the
solution.

# Omit if none
Addiitional Bugs Fixed:
- Bug1 short description
- Bug2 short description

# Omit if none, this is for things like "made code follow pep8"
Additional Changes or Minor Fixes:
- Minor change short description
- Minor change 2 short description
```

A real world example of what you will see after a rebase following the above
example would be this:

```
# This is a combination of 3 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

write apache and nginx docs

# This is the commit message #2:

WIP: update deployment docs

# This is the commit message #3:

WIP: Fix tox config so it matches new settings

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Wed Jul 26 16:18:17 2017 -0400
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 5c5add7
# Last commands done (3 commands done):
#    squash 7453537 WIP: update deployment docs
#    squash 54bac41 WIP: Fix tox config so it matches new settings
# No commands remaining.
# You are currently rebasing branch 'more-docs' on '5c5add7'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   README.md
#       modified:   docs/README.md

#       deleted:    docs/hacking/README.md
#       modified:   docs/index.html
#       modified:   tox.ini
#
```

We would change this to the following commit message:

```
Update Documentation

This updates the deployment documentatino for Linux. Reorganizes the sidebar so
that it's more clear and managed inside a single file. Additionally this
includes "advanced" topics like configuring a reverse proxy for Praelatus, How
to set up and develop on Praelatus, and how to use git on this project.

Bug Fixes:
- The tox.ini file was using an old environment variable to configure the
  database this commit updates it to the new environment variables to use
  Sqlite.

```

From that point you can push to your fork with:

```bash
git push --force
```

Finally you will [open a pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on Github
and it will automatically populate the PR with the well written commit message.
From there a member of the core team will perform a code review and any
additional changes as a result of that code review should not be squashed and
instead should be separate commits for each review rejection.
